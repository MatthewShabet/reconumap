    neighbor. That is, this is similar to knn-distance but allows continuous
    k values rather than requiring an integral k. In essence we are simply
    computing the distance such that the cardinality of fuzzy set we generate
    is k.

    Parameters
    ----------
    distances: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors)
        Distances to nearest neighbors for each sample. Each row should be a
        sorted list of distances to a given samples nearest neighbors.

    k: float
        The number of nearest neighbors to approximate for.

    n_iter: int (optional, default 64)
        We need to binary search for the correct distance value. This is the
        max number of iterations to use in such a search.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    bandwidth: float (optional, default 1)
        The target bandwidth of the kernel, larger values will produce
        larger return values.

    Returns
    -------
    knn_dist: array of shape (n_samples,)
        The distance to kth nearest neighbor, as suitably approximated.

    nn_dist: array of shape (n_samples,)
        The distance to the 1st nearest neighbor for each point.

    locally approximating geodesic distance at each point, creating a fuzzy
    simplicial set for each such point, and then combining all the local
    fuzzy simplicial sets into a global one via a fuzzy union.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array of shape (n_samples, n_features)
        The data to be modelled as a fuzzy simplicial set.

    n_neighbors: int
        The number of neighbors to use to approximate geodesic distance.
        Larger numbers induce more global estimates of the manifold that can
        miss finer detail, while smaller values will focus on fine manifold
        structure to the detriment of the larger picture.

    knn_indices: array of shape (n_samples, n_neighbors) (optional)
        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the indices of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.

        If the k-nearest neighbors of each point has already been calculated
        you can pass them in here to save computation time. This should be
        an array with the distances of the k-nearest neighbors as a row for
        each data point.

    set_op_mix_ratio: float (optional, default 1.0)
        Interpolate between (fuzzy) union and intersection as the set operation
        used to combine local fuzzy simplicial sets to obtain a global fuzzy
        simplicial sets. Both fuzzy set operations use the product t-norm.
        The value of this parameter should be between 0.0 and 1.0; a value of
        1.0 will use a pure fuzzy union, while 0.0 will use a pure fuzzy
        intersection.

    local_connectivity: int (optional, default 1)
        The local connectivity required -- i.e. the number of nearest
        neighbors that should be assumed to be connected at a local level.
        The higher this value the more connected the manifold becomes
        locally. In practice this should be not more than the local intrinsic
        dimension of the manifold.

    Returns
    -------
    fuzzy_simplicial_set: coo_matrix
        A fuzzy simplicial set represented as a sparse matrix. The (i,
        j) entry of the matrix represents the membership strength of the
        1-simplex between the ith and jth sample points.
